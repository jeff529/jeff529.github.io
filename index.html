                <p> Anargyros Nicholas Karabourniotis (Ανάργυρος Καραβουρνιώτης), commonly known as Archie Karas, is a Greek
                    American gambler, high roller, poker player, and pool shark. He is famous for the largest and longest
                    documented winning streak in casino gambling history, simply known as The Run, when he drove to Las Vegas
                    with $50 in December 1992 and then turned a $10,000 loan into more than $40 million by the beginning
                    of 1995, only to lose it all later that year.</p>

                        happiness. I don't care about money, so I have no fear. I don't care if I lose it."</p>
